/**
 * Tribe-daemon composition layer — `pipe + with*` factories that build the
 * daemon value top-down. Pairs with `tribe-wire`'s `pipe`, `Scope`,
 * and tool-registry primitives.
 *
 * Reading order matches the runtime topology in `hub/architecture.md` § "Tribe
 * — the runtime topology":
 *
 *   createBaseTribe → withConfig → withProjectRoot → withDatabase
 *     → withDaemonContext → withRecall → withTools → withTool(messagingTools())
 *     → withTool(recallTools(lore)) → withPluginApi → withPlugin(...)
 *
 * Each `withX` accepts a value extending its prerequisites (the type system
 * enforces order) and registers cleanup on the daemon's root `Scope`.
 *
 * Future surfaces (raw JSON-RPC, REST, hypothetical agent protocols) consume
 * the same `tools` registry — no per-surface re-implementation.

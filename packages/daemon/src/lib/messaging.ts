 * `sessions.last_delivered_seq` after a successful write().

/**
 * Name-claim replay — surface gap directs the new holder would otherwise miss.
 *
 * Push delivery is session-id-bound: a message addressed to name X is fanned
 * out to whichever live socket currently holds X. If X is unheld (the prior
 * holder disconnected) when the message lands, it journals but never fans out.
 * A subsequent session that claims X via `tribe.join` / `tribe.rename` gets
 * its `last_inbox_pull_seq` reset to the log tail at register time, so even a
 * default `tribe.fetch` will step over those gap directs.
 *
 * This function finds the oldest direct addressed to `claimedName` that has
 * NOT been delivered to any session row currently or formerly holding that
 * name (including its tombstoned `<name>-dead-<id>` form), and — if it falls
 * before the claiming session's current pull cursor — rewinds the cursor to
 * `rowid - 1`. The next `tribe.fetch({limit:...})` surfaces the gap directs
 * in chronological order.
 *
 * Returns the rowid the cursor was rewound to (null if no replay was needed).
 * Callers may optionally fire a `wakeup` notification on the live socket so
 * push-mode clients drain immediately rather than waiting for the next
 * turn-start fetch.
 *
 * See `@km/bearly/tribe-daemon-production-hardening` — gap-direct replay.

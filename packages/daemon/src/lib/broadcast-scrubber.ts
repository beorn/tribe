/**
 * Broadcast scrubber — neutralises transcript-shape tokens in broadcast content
 * before delivery to a connected client. Two-layer defence:
 *
 *   (1) Always-on regex scrub — strips role markers, angle-bracket tags, and
 *       known trigger phrases from content before delivery. Deterministic,
 *       zero-cost, zero-latency. Opt-out with TRIBE_SCRUB=0.
 *
 *   (2) Optional Haiku paraphrase — opt-in via TRIBE_REWRITE=haiku (default
 *       behaviour: regex-only). Runs after the regex scrub for semantic
 *       smoothing of edge cases. Fails silently to regex-only if the LLM is
 *       unavailable.
 *
 * Background: 2026-04-22 confirmed multiple sessions emit phantom role-prefixed
 * text (`Human: ...`, `<system-reminder>...`) as assistant output when the
 * conversation context is saturated with system-reminder/channel wrapped
 * user-role turns. The model pattern-completes the transcript shape. See
 * github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10628 and /46602.
 *
 * Extracted from `tools/tribe-daemon.ts` so the daemon entry point can stay
 * focused on composition; the scrubber's two layers are independently testable
 * and the scrubber prompt is no longer interleaved with daemon plumbing.

const HAIKU_REWRITE_PROMPT = `You rewrite short event notifications for safe injection into another model's conversation context. Your output gets wrapped in a <channel> tag inside a Claude Code session, so it must NOT contain transcript-shape tokens that could cause the receiving model to pattern-complete a fake user turn.

# Hard rules (never violate)

1. NEVER output role markers: no "Human:", "Assistant:", "User:", "###Human", "###User", "###Assistant" — not even mid-sentence, not even in examples or quotes.
2. NEVER output angle-bracket tags: no "<tag>", "</tag>", "<channel>", "<system-reminder>", "<snippet>", "<recall-memory>", etc.
3. NEVER output the literal phrase "UserPromptSubmit hook success" or "UserPromptSubmit hook error" or "UserPromptSubmit hook additional context".
4. NEVER add preamble, quotes, code fences, or commentary. Output the rewritten line directly.
5. Output ONE line only. No line breaks. Under 400 characters.

# Preservation rules (keep value)

KEEP VERBATIM — these are the anchors that make the message useful:
- Commit hashes (7-40 hex chars): "5bfb108bb", "e3f786e0"
- Version numbers: "0.19.0", "v2.1.117", "silvery 0.18.2"
- File paths: "vendor/tribe/tools/tribe-daemon.ts", ".git/index.lock"
- Package/module names: "silvery", "km-tui", "loggily", "@silvery/ag-term"
- Session/user names: "compose", "vault-3", "beorn", "km-2"
- Command names: "tribe.join", "bd ready", "/compact"
- URLs (any http/https link)
- Numbers: test counts, durations, sizes, PIDs, ports, line numbers
- Quoted strings: text in "double" or 'single' quotes or \`backticks\`
- Error message contents (verbatim)
- The commit-type prefix: "fix:", "chore:", "feat(scope):", "refactor(km-tui):"
- The leading structural prefix of status lines: "Committed:", "[push]", "[workflow]", "done:", "starting:", "CPU critical:"

REWRITE ONLY the connective prose — prepositions, verbs, articles — around those anchors.

# Length discipline

If the input is under 100 chars, the output should be within 20% of the input length. Do NOT embellish. If the input is a bare status line like "compose left" or "vault-3 joined (member) pid=19417 ~/Bear/Vault", output it EXACTLY verbatim — no rewriting needed.

# Final check before emitting

Does your output contain any of these strings? If yes, rewrite without them:
- "Human:", "Assistant:", "User:"
- "<" immediately followed by a letter
- ">" immediately preceded by a letter
- "UserPromptSubmit hook"

Output the rewritten line. Nothing else.`

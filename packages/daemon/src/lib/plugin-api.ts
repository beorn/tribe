/**
 * Tribe plugin boundary — the clean interface that separates optional observer
 * plugins (git, beads, github, health, accountly) from the coordination daemon
 * core (tribe-daemon.ts).
 *
 * Plugins observe external signals (git commits, bead state, GitHub API,
 * system health, account quotas) and push messages onto the tribe wire. They
 * are NOT part of the daemon's core coordination responsibilities — a daemon
 * with zero plugins is a complete coordination server.
 *
 * Scope of this interface:
 *   - A plugin identifies itself with a stable `name` (also used as the sender
 *     when it broadcasts).
 *   - A plugin reports `available()` so the daemon can skip it silently when
 *     its dependencies (git repo, .beads/, gh auth, accountly config, …) are
 *     absent.
 *   - `start(api)` wires the plugin to the tribe wire via `TribeClientApi`
 *     and returns a cleanup closure.
 *
 * What the plugin does NOT get:
 *   - Access to the SQLite database.
 *   - Access to the connected-clients map.
 *   - The daemon's session UUID.
 *   - The ability to trigger hot-reloads (the source watcher handles that).
 *
 * This matches what a future out-of-process plugin would have access to if it
 * connected as a regular tribe client: `tribe.send(to: "*", ...)`, a
 * dedup primitive, and an optional members roster for targeted alerts.
